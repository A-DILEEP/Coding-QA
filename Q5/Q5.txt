Given the array of prices of the stock on each day, you need to figure out the best strategy to maximize your profit.

However, if the stock prices are constantly decreasing, there is no way for you to make a profit.


Example 1:

Input:

7

arr[] = {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695}

Output:

865

Explanation:

Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 => 310 – 100 = 210

Buy the stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6 => 695 – 40 = 655

Maximum Profit = 210 + 655 = 865


Example 2:

Input:

5

arr[] = {4, 2, 2, 2, 4}

Output:

2
Explanation:

Buy the stock on day 1 and sell it on day 4 => 4 – 2 = 2

Maximum Profit = 2



Input format :
The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of days.

The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the stock prices on consecutive days.

Output format :
The output prints a single integer, which is the maximum profit that can be achieved.
